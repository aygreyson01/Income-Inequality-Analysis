# Income-Inequality-Analysis
![IMG](income_inequality.png)
I've always had an interest in bettering the world, and what better way to raise awareness than identifying trends leading to inequality. In this project, I decided to collect data from the WHO on wealth inequality and identify contributing factors. This data set was created from an xls export fom [here](https://www.wider.unu.edu/database/wiid) and then converted into a CSV with over 195 countries and over 2000 specific regions total. 

The current CSV file with over 2000 rows is located here. Finally, I will conduct my analysis using both Excel and Python.
